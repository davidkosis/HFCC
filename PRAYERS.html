          <span style="font-weight: 700;">The Rosary</span>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Introduction</span>
          <br>The Rosary is a centuries-old prayer rooted in meditating on the life of Jesus Christ. The prayers of the Rosary are to be said while simultaneously contemplating on specific moments in the life of Jesus Christ. Therefore, the Rosary is not just “vain repetition.” But like the 150 Psalms which inspired the original 150 prayers of the Rosary, the Rosary provides the universal Church with a method of continuously calling out with hope to God, through the intercession of Mary, the Mother of God.<br>
          <br>There are four different “sets” of mysteries of the Rosary, typically prayed on different days:<br>. Sundays and Wednesdays – The Glorious Mysteries<br>. Mondays and Saturdays – The Joyful Mysteries<br>. Tuesdays and Fridays – The Sorrowful Mysteries,<br>. Thursdays – The Luminous Mysteries).&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Each of these Mysteries are based on Scripture.<br>The Rosary is comprised of 5 decades, that is, 5 sets of 10 knots/beads, which comprise a circle. &nbsp;<br>Each decade is separated by a larger knot/bead (used to pray the Our Father). The knots knots/beads outside of the circle are used for opening and closed prayers, provided below.&nbsp;<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Bless Yourself Holding the Crucifix of your Rosary</span>
          <br>&nbsp;In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.&nbsp; (As you say this, touch your forehead with your right hand when you say Father, touch your breastbone with you say Son, touch your left shoulder when you say Holy, and touch your right shoulder when you say Spirit).<br>Then, recite THE CREED, as follows:<br>I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of Heaven and Earth.&nbsp; And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.&nbsp; He descended into Hell.&nbsp; The third day he rose again from the dead.&nbsp; He ascended into Heaven and sits at the right hand of God, the Father almighty.&nbsp; He shall come again to judge the living and the dead.&nbsp; I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.&nbsp; Amen.&nbsp;<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Opening Prayers:THE OUR FATHER</span>
          <br>&nbsp;Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.<br>For an increase in the virtues of Faith, Hope, and Love, pray the Hail Mary three times.<br>HAIL MARY&nbsp;– Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>Then pray the following prayers 1 time each:<br>THE GLORY BE&nbsp;– Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>FATIMA PRAYER&nbsp;– Oh my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of Hell; lead all souls to Heaven, especially those in most need of Thy mercy. Amen.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Pray 5 Decades</span>
          <br>A Rosary is comprised of 5 decades (sets of ten) prayers, each proceeded by an Our Father and concluded by The Glory Be and Fatima Prayer.<br>To pray the first decade, start on the large center knot after the opening prayers and pray The Our Father.<br>Then, moving to each of the next ten smaller knots/beads, pray a Hail Mary on each knot.<br>After praying ten Hail Mary prayers, pray The Glory Be followed by The Fatima Prayer. &nbsp;<br>Repeat this pattern of one Our Father, ten Hail Marys, one Glory Be, and one Fatima Prayer until you’ve gone around all five decades of a full Rosary.&nbsp;<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Concluding Prayers</span>
          <br>THE OUR FATHER&nbsp;– Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.<br>For an increase in the virtues of Faith, Hope, and Love, pray the Hail Mary three times.<br>HAIL MARY&nbsp;– Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.<br>Then pray the following prayers 1 time each:<br>THE GLORY BE&nbsp;– Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.<br>FATIMA PRAYER&nbsp;– Oh my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of Hell; lead all souls to Heaven, especially those in most need of Thy mercy. Amen.<br>
